# Hush — Core Features

Hush is a location-based focus app that helps you stay productive by automatically restricting distracting apps when you enter a selected area.

## Core Setup
1. **Set a Focus Area**
   - Choose a location where you want to focus (e.g., office, library, school, café).
   - Define the area/range around that location.

2. **Choose What to Block**
   - Select **apps** or **app categories** you want to restrict (e.g., social media, games).

## How It Works
- When you **enter your Focus Area**, Hush **automatically activates** restrictions for the apps/categories you selected.
- This helps you **focus on work or study** and **break free from social media** in the places where you want better habits.

## Key Idea
**You choose the place. You choose what to block. Hush enforces it automatically when you arrive.**
